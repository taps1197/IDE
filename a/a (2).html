<br>Jaguar was founded as the Swallow Sidecar company by Sir William Lyons in 1922, originally making motorcycle sidecars before developing passenger cars.  
The name was changed to Jaguar after World War II to avoid the unfavourable connotations of the SS initials.[3] Following a merger with the British Motor  
Corporation in 1968, subsequently subsumed by Leyland, which itself was later nationalised as British Leyland, Jaguar was listed on the London Stock Exchange  
in 1984, and became a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index until it was acquired by Ford in 1990.[4] Jaguar has, in recent years, manufactured cars for the  
Prime Minister, the most recent delivery being an XJ in May 2010.[5] The company also holds royal warrants from HM Queen Elizabeth II and HRH Prince Charles.
